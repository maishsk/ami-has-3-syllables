A.M.I. has the same number as Hello World. Yup 3!
The number of syllables in A.M.I. rhymes with pee. It does not rhyme with poo!
You would never pronounce it ahh-wsss - A.M.I. has 3 syllables
No-one say that AWS rhymes with "jaws"
E.C.2. has #3syllables 
S3 also had #3syllables S.S.S.
Lex - clever play on Alexa. 
A-Lex-A has #3syllables - just like AMI



AMI should be pronounced as A-M-I. I am biased (obviously) but I think that even @awscloud is pretty much on board with the fact that their 3 letter product names should all be pronounced with #3syllables 

A thread...

@awscloud has 25 (yes) I counted them 25 different products with exactly 3 letters in them (or derivatives of) - lets go through them one at a time.

A-C-M AWS Certificate Manager - Not ac-em (also not hack-em) #3syllables
D-M-S Database Migration Service - Not dems nor dee-miss (and also not dimms) #3syllables
E-C-2 (Well is should actually be E-C-C - but EC2 sounds so much sexier) Elastic Compute Cloud - Not ek-2 (or even eck - other people might get confused with "what the heck2") #3syllables
E-C-R - Elastic Container Registry - Not Ecker-R (sounds too much like pecker) #3syllables
E-C-S - Elastic Container Service - Not eh-ckes neither ee-cees nor Ex (People would be wary to use a product named Amazon X - they might think that AWS is taking after Google with their Alphabet) #3syllables
E-F-S - Elastic File System - Not ef-s neither ee-fees nor eefs #3syllables 
E-K-S - Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes - pronouncing this x-kay (ECS-K) would sound too much like Xray (another AWS product). Also see above about E-C-S #3syllables
E-M-R Elastic MapReduce - Nope we don't call it ee-mer - nor emmer (otherwise all the Dutch people might think that this is an S3 look-alike) #3syllables
F-S-X - I can't find what this stands for - except for FSx :) - not ef-sex (that is not politically correct..) #3syllables
I-A-M - Identity and Access Managment - no-one uses I-AM - (Dr. Suess would be happy with I-AM-SAM - SAM-I-AM) #3syllables
I-O-T - Internet Of Things - Not eye-ot (people might think there are more than 7 dwarfs in the service - eye-o, eye-o it's off to work we go..) #3syllables
K-M-S Key Management Service - Not kems - nor kee-mes (keemes - the new AWS meme-as-a-service product is probably not a good idea either) #3syllables
L-E-X - this is actually the product name - Amazon Lex - even though the French might have enjoyed it if it was actually Le'X (but then again people don't like having their Ex in the spotlight) #3syllables
M-S-K - Managed Streaming for Kafka musk (Elon might not like it), em-sek (could be too fast for us to use) #3syllables
P-H-D - Personal Health Dashboard - Not pee-hud and phud - would get them in trouble with spreading Fear Uncertainty and Doubt #3syllables
R-A-M - Resource Access Manager - Not (a battering) ram (nor the the ancient Indian king Raam) #3syllables
R-D-S - Relational Database Service - Not ar-dis, nor ar-dees (and definitely not the new time machine service - tardis) #3syllables
s3 - Simple Storage Service - This is a 3 letter product - S-S-S (S3 is so much sexier) - Not sss (people might think there are snakes) - here I conceded - ess-ess-ess brings up really bad vibes #3syllables
S-E-S - Simple Email Service - Not Sess nor sees (otherwise us customers might think this is a new tax in eu-west-1 or ap-south-1) #3syllables
S-N-S - Simple notification Service - Not S-ness, neither sneeze nor Sans (and not nessie either - she is still somewhere in the Loch) #3syllables
S-Q-S - Simple Queue Service - Not See-ques - nor squeeze #3syllables
S-S-O - Single Sign On - Not sa-so neither ses-o nor se-so (just because I say so) #3syllables
S-W-F - Simple Workflow Service - Not see-wiff - nor Swiff #3syllables
V-P-C - Virtual Private Cloud - Not a vee-pic, neither ve-peec nor veep-see #3syllables
W-A-F - Web - Application Firewall - I concede - this one is #1syllable - there I said it! BUT IT IS NOT #2syllables !!

Except for three exceptions (S3, LEX and WAF) - All the three letter products in @awscloud - are all three effing syllables!!!! #3syllables 

Just like A-M-I - three effing syllables #3syllables
