E-C-R - Elastic Container Registry - Not Ecker-R (sounds too much like pecker) #3syllables

E-F-S - Elastic File System - Not ef-s neither ee-fees nor eefs #3syllables

L-E-X - this is actually the product name - Amazon Lex - even though the French might have enjoyed it if it was actually Le'X (but then again people don't like having their Ex in the spotlight) #3syllables
M-S-K - Managed Streaming for Kafka. It is not pronounced musk (Elon might not like it), em-sek (could be too fast for us to use) #3syllables
